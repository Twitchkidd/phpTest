# php ... let\'s do this.

First order of business, getting autoformatting going. Prettier for JS development has absolutely spoiled me. Here's where we're at:

* MAMP on latest version, so localhost:8888/index.php is up
* Added "PHP IntelliSense" extension in VSCode
* Wondering what I've missed, and how I got Prettier working

Oh, and for the actual installation of php and all that, I guess I handled that or it was built in, anyway, I ran ```php``` and could run php, so ... cool.

Oh you know what, I didn't look at "phpfmt - PHP formatter" for VSCode, I'm fucking stupid, wrong extension. I got distracted because at the moment I haven't pointed MAMP to any folder, so I had to ```cp index.php /[PATH]/index.php``` and instinctively reached for git.

Lol, jk, this is not as simple as it first seemed. TWILL be returned to. For the moment, def lol re: the indents in my code.
